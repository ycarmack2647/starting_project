# DevSecOps Demonstration Project

This project is a simple, secure website that demonstrates various DevSecOps practices and CI/CD pipeline integration using GitHub Actions.

## Features

This setup showcases several DevSecOps practices:

1. Content Security Policy implemented in the HTML file.
2. Security headers defined in the `_headers` file.
3. Client-side security checks in JavaScript.
4. GitHub Actions workflow that includes:
   - Linting
   - Testing
   - Security audit of npm packages
   - Checking for sensitive data in the repository
   - Deployment to GitHub Pages
5. Use of HTTPS (when deployed to GitHub Pages)

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file with Content Security Policy
- `styles.css`: CSS styles for the website
- `script.js`: JavaScript file with client-side security checks
- `_headers`: File defining security headers
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- `package.json`: Node.js project file with dependencies and scripts
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run linting: `npm run lint`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

## Deployment

This project is set up to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Future Enhancements

To make this project more comprehensive, consider adding:

- A simple API with proper authentication
- More complex security checks on the client-side
- Content Security Policy Report-Only header with a reporting endpoint
- Automated accessibility testing in the CI/CD pipeline
- A simple backend with security headers, integrated into the CI/CD pipeline

## Best Practices

Remember to regularly update your dependencies and review your security practices as part of your DevSecOps approach.
